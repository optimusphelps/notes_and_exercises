Using the covering map $\epsilon^2:\bbR^2\mapsto\bbT^2$ (see Example 4.35), show that the immersion $X:\bbR^2\mapsto\bbR^3$ defined in example 4.2(d) descends to a smooth embedding of $\bbT^2$ into $\bbR^3$.  Specifically, show that $X$ passes to the quotient to define a smooth map $\tilde{X}:\bbT^2\mapsto\bbR^3$, and then show that $\tilde{X}$ is a smooth embedding whose image is the given surface of revolution.
