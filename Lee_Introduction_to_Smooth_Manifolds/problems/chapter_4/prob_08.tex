This problem shows that the converse of Theorem 4.29 is false.  Let $\pi:\bbR^2:\mapsto\bbR$ be defined by $\pi(x,y)_ =xy$.  Show that $\pi$ is surjective and smooth, and for each smooth manifold $P$, a map $F:\bbR\mapsto P$ is smooth if and only if $F\circ\pi$ is smooth; but $\pi$ is not a smooth submersion.
