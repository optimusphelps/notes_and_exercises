Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold and $S\subseteq M$ is a smooth submanifold.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Show that $S$ is embedded if and only if every $f \in C^\infty(S)$ has a smooth extension to a neighborhood of $S$ in $M$. [Hint: if $S$ is not embedded, let $p \in S$ be a point that is not in the domain of any slice chart.  Let $U$ be a neighborhood of $p$ in $S$ that is embedded, and consider a function $f \in C^\infty(S)$ that is supported in $U$ and equal to $1$ at $p$.]
\item Show that $S$ is properly embedded if and only if every $f \in C^\infty(S)$ has a smooth extension to all of $M$.
\end{enumerate}
