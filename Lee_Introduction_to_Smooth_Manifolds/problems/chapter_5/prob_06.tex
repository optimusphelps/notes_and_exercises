Suppose $M \subseteq \bbR^n$ is an embedded $m$-dimensional submanifold, and let $UM\subseteq T\bbR^n$ be the set of all unit tangent vectors to $M$:
\begin{equation*}
UM = \left\{(x,v)\in T\bbR^n: x\in M, v \in T_xM, \vert v \vert = 1\right\}.
\end{equation*}
It is called the unit tanget bundle of $M$.  Prove that $UM$ is an embedded $(2m-1)$-dimensional submanifold of $T\bbR^n\approx \bbR \times bbR$.
