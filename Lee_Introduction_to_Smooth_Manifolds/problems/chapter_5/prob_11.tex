Let $\Phi:\bbR^2 \mapsto \bbR$ be defined by $\Phi(x,y)= x^2 - y^2$.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Show that $\phi^{-1}(0)$ is not an embedded submanifold of $\bbR^2$.
\item Can $\phi^{-1}(0)$ be given a topology and smooth structure making it into an immersed submanifold of $\bbR^2$?
\item Answer the same two questions for $\Psi:\bbR^2\mapsto\bbR$ defined by $\Psi(x,y)=x^2-y^3$.
\end{enumerate}
