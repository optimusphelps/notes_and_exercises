Prove Lemma 5.34: Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold, $S \subseteq M$ is a smooth submanifold, and $f \in C^\infty(S)$.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item If $S$ is embedded, then there exist a neighborhood $U$ of $S$ in $M$ and a smooth function $\tilde{f} \in C^\infty(U)$ such that $\tilde{f}|_S = f$.
\item If $S$ is properly embedded, then the neighborhood $U$ in part $(a)$ can be taken to be all of $M$.
\end{enumerate}
