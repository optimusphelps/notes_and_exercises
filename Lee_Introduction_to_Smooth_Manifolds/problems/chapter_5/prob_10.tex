For each $a\in \bbR$, let $M_a$ be the subset of $\bbR^2$ defined by
\begin{equation*}
M_a = \left\{(x,y):y^2=x(x-1)(x-a)\right\}.
\end{equation*}
For which values of $a$ is $M_a$ an embedded submanifold of $\bbR^2$?  For which values can $M_a$ be given a topology and smooth structure making it into an immersed submanifold?
