Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold with boundary, $N$ is a smooth manifold, and $F:M\mapsto N$ is a smooth map.  Let $S=F^{-1}(c)$, where $c \in N$ is a regular value for both $F$ and $F|_{\partial M}$.  Prove that $S$ is a smooth submanifold with boundary in $M$, with $\partial S =S \cap \partial M$.
