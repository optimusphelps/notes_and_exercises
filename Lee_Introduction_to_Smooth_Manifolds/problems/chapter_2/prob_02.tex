Prove Proposition 2.12: Suppose $M_1\times\ldots\times M_k$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, such that at most one of $M_1,\ldots,M_k$ has nonempty boundary. For each $i$, let $pi_i:M_1\times\ldots\times M_k \mapsto M_i$ denote the projection onto the $M_i$ factor. A map $F:N \mapsto M_1\times\ldots\times M_k$ is smooth if and only if each of the component maps $F_i=\pi_i \circ F:N \ M_i$ is smooth.
