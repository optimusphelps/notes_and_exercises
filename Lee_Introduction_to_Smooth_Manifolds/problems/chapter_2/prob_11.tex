Suppose $V$ is a real vector space of dimension $n\geq 1$.  Define the projectivization of $V$, denoted $\mathbb{P}(V)$, to be the set of 1-dimensional linear subspaces of $V$, with the quotient topology induced by the map $\pi:V\setminus\{0\}\mapsto \mathbb{P}(V)$ that sends $x$ to its span.  Show that $\mathbb{P}(V)$ is a topological $(n-1)$-submanifold, and has a unique smooth structure with the property that for each basis $(E_1, \ldots, E_n)$ for $V$, the map $E:\mathbb{RP}^{n-1}\mapsto \mathbb{P}(V)$ defined by $E[v^1,\ldots,v^n]=[v^1E_i]$ (where brackes denote equivalence classes) is a diffeomorphism.
