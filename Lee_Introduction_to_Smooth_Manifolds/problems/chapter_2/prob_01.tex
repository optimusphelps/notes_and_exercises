Define $f:\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R}$ by (Heaviside function)

Show that for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$, there are smooth coordinate charts $(U, \phi)$ containing $x$ and $(V, \psi)$ containing $f(x)$ such that $\psi \cdot f \cdot \phi^{-1}$ is smooth as a map from $(\phi(U \cap f^{-1}(V)))$ to $\psi(V)$ but $f$ is not smooth in the sense we have defined in this chapter.
