Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the real line with its standard smooth structure, and let $\tilde{\mathbb{R}}$ denote the same topological manifold with the smooth structure defined in Example 1.23.  Let $f:\mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ be a function that is smooth in the usual sense.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $f$ is also smooth as a map from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\tilde{\mathbb{R}}$.
\item Show that $f$ is smooth as a map from $\tilde{\mathbb{R}}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ if and only if $f^(n)(0) = 0$ whenever $n$ is not an integral multiple of 3.
\end{enumerate}
