For any topological space $M$, let $C(M)$ denote the algebra of continuous functions $f:M\mapsto\mathbb{R}$.  Given a continuous map $F:M\mapsto\mathbb{N}$, define $F^*:C(N)\mapsto C(M)$ by $F^*(f) = f \circ F$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $F^*$ is a linear map.
\item Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds.  Show that $F:M\mapsto N$ is smooth if and only if $F^*(C^\infty(N))\subseteq C^\infty(M)$.
\item Suppose $F:M\mapsto N$ is a homeomorphism between smooth manifolds.  Show that it is a diffeomorphism if and only if $F^*$ restricts to an isomorphism from $C^\infty(N)$ to $C^\infty(M)$.
\end{enumerate}
