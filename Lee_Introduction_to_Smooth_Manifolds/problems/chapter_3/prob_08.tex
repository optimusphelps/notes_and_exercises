Let M be a smooth manifold with or without boundary and $p \in M$.  Let $\mathcal{V}_p M$ denote the set of equivalence classes of smooth curves starting at $p$ under the relation $\gamma_1 = \gamma_2$ if $(f \circ \gamma)'(0) = (f \circ \gamma_2)'(0)$ for every smooth real valued function $f$ defined in a neighborhood of $p$. Show that the map $\Psi:\mathcal{V}_pM \mapsto T_pM$ defined by $\Psi[\gamma] = \gamma'(0)$ is well-defined and bijective.
