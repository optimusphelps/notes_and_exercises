Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary and $p$ be a point of $M$.  Let $C^\infty_p(M)$ denote the algebra of germs of smooth real-valued functions at $p$, and let $\mathcal{D}_pM$ denote the vector space of derivations of $C_p^\infty(M)$.  Define a map $\Phi:\mathcal{D}_p M\mapsto T_p M$ by $(\Phi v)f = v([f]_p)$.  Show that $\Phi$ is an isomorphism.
