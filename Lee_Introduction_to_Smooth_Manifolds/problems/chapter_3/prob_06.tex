Consider $\mathbb{S}^3$ as the unit sphere in $\mathbb{C}^2$ under the usual identification.  For each $z = (z^1, z^2) \in \mathbb{S}^3$, define a curve $\gamma_z:\mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{S}^3$ by $\gamma_z = e^{it}z^1, e^{it} z^2)$.  Show that $\gamma_z$ is a smooth curve whose velocity is never zero.
