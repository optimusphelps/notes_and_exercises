Let $\mathbb{S}^1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be the unit circle, and let $K \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be the boundary of the square of side 2 centered at the origin.  Show that there is a homeomorphism $F: \mathbb{R}^2 \mapsto \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $F(\mathbb{S}^1) = K$ but no diffeomorphism with the same property.
