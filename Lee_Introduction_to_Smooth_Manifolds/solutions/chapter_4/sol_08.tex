$\pi$ is smooth because it is a product of smooth functions.

Surjectivity of $\pi$ is clear because the function $\pi(\cdot, 1):\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R}$ is the identity.

$\pi$ is not a smooth submersion because it is not constant rank (this can be seen by observing that $d\pi=0$ at $y=0$ or $x=0$, but $d\pi\neq0$ otherwise.

$F$ smooth $\implies$ $F \circ \pi$ is smooth because it is a composition of smooth functions.

If $F \circ \pi$ is smooth, then its component functions are smooth. In particular, the component function of $x$ when $y=1$ is smooth.  However, $(F\circ\pi) (x,1) = F(x)$, so $F$ is smooth.
