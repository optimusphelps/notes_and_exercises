$\pi$ is smooth because it is a product of smooth functions.

Surjectivity of $\pi$ is clear because the function $\pi(\cdot, 1):\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R}$ is the identity.

$\pi$ is not a smooth submersion because it is not constant rank (this can be seen by observing that $d\pi=0$ at $y=0$ or $x=0$, but $d\pi\neq0$ otherwise.

$F$ smooth $\implies$ $F \circ \pi$ is smooth because it is a composition of smooth functions.

Let $\hat{\pi}:\mathbb{R}\mapsto\mathbb{R}^2$ s.t. $\pi(x) = (x,1)$.  $\hat{\pi}$ is clearly smooth. If $F \circ \pi$ is smooth, then $F = F \circ \pi \circ \hat{\pi}$ is smoooth because it is a composition of smooth functions.
