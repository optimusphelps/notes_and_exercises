Let $p \in \partial \bbH^n$ and note that:

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item The inclusion $\bbH^n \inc \bbR^n$ is smooth.
\item $d \iota_p$ is invertible. \textbf{[NOTE: why? look up definition]}
\end{enumerate}

However, there are no neighborhoods $U \ni p, V \ni F(P)$, s.t. $\iota|_U:U\mapsto V$ is a diffeomorphism.  To see this, note that every $U$ is open in $\bbH^N$ but each $V \ni F(p)$ is not open in $\bbR^n$.
