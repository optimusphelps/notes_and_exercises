Let $M$ be compact and $F:M\mapsto\bbR^k$ be smooth.

Note that
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item $F(M)$ is compact because $M$ is compact and $F$ is continuous.
\item $F(M)$ is open because $F$ is a smooth submersion.
\end{enumerate}

Because all non-empty compact sets in $\bbR^k$ are closed, this is a contradiction and such a map cannot exist.
