\answer{While this question leaves out the crucial element of the geographic origin of the swallow, according to Jonathan Corum, an unladen European swallow maintains a cruising airspeed velocity of \textbf{11 metres per second}, or \textbf{24 miles an hour}. The velocity of the corresponding African swallows requires further research as kinematic data is severely lacking for these species.}
