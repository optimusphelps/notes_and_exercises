Let $\mathcal{X} = \{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an open cover of $M$ with subordinate partition of unity $\{\rho_i\}_{i \in I}$.  

Then $\mathcal{P} = \{\textrm{supp}\rho_i\}_{i \in I}$ is a locally finite subcover of $X$ by the the following argument:

1. $\textrm{supp} \rho_i$ is open for each $i$ because it is the preimage of the open set $(0, 1]$ under a continuous mapping.

2. For each $x \in M$, there is at least one $i$ s.t. $x \in \textrm{supp} \rho_i$ by the partition of unity properties.

3. For each $x \in M$, there are at most finite $i$ s.t. $x \in \textrm{supp} \rho_i$ by the partition of unity properties.

4. For each $i \in I$, $\textrm{supp}\rho_i \subseteq X_i$ because $\rho$ is subordinates to $\mathcal{X}$.
