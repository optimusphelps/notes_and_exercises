First note that 

\begin{equation*}
d\Phi|_p = 
\left(
	\begin{matrix}
	2x_p & 1 & 0 & 0
	\\
	2x_p& 2y_p+1 & 2s_p & 2t_p
	\end{matrix}
\right)
\end{equation*}
Note that if $d\Phi|_p$ has rank $\leq 2$, then $x_p = s_p = t_p = 0$.  

However, at the value $\Phi(p^*)=(0,1)$, $x_p = s_p = t_p = 0$ implies that $y^2 + y = 1$ therefore $y=\frac{1 + \pm \sqrt{6}}{2}$, therefore $2y+1 \neq 0$.  Thus $d\Phi$ has rank 2 for all points on the level curve $\Phi^{-1}(0,1)$, and thus $(0,1)$ is a regular value.

Now, the manifold given by $\Phi^{-1}(0,1)$ must satisfy the system of equations 

\begin{align*}

x^2 + y = & \, 0
\\
x^2 + y + y^2 + s^2 + t^2 = & \, 1
\\
\iff
\\
y^2 + s^2 + t^2 = & \, 1
\end{align*}
TODO: but why diffeomorphic?
