First note that the inclusion map is an injective smooth immersion.  Then

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Consequence of Proposition 4.22d applied to the inclusion map.  In the case where both $S$ and $M$ have nonempty boundary, 4.22d can be applied to $\Int S$ and $\partial S$ separately.
\item Consequence of Proposition 4.22b applied to the inclusion map.
\item Consequence of Proposition 4.22C applied to the inclusion map.
\end{enumerate}
