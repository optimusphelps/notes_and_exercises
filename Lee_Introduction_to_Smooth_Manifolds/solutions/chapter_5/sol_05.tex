Associate $bbT^2=\bbS\times\bbS$ with $\bbC^2$ in the usual way and let $\gamma:\bbR\mapsto\bbT^2$ be defined by

\begin{equation*}
\gamma(t) = (e^{2\pi i t}, e^{2\pi \alpha i t}
\end{equations*}

We will show that $\gamma(\bbR)$ is not an embedded manifold by showing that $\gamma(0)$ does not admit a locally Euclidean neighborhood.

Let $(U, \phi)$ be the coordinate chart constructed by identifying $bbT^2=\bbS\times\bbS$ with $\bbC^2$ in the usual way, letting $\phi^{-1}:\bbR^2 \mapsto \bbS\times\bbS$ s.t. $\phi^{-1}(s,t) = (e^{2 \pi i s}, e^{2 \pi i t})$, and $U = \phi^{-1}(B_\epsilon(0))$.

In this chart, $\phi^{-1}(\gamma \cap U)$ = \{(s,t) \vert t = \alpha s + \beta, \beta = n \alpha \mod 1\}$.
