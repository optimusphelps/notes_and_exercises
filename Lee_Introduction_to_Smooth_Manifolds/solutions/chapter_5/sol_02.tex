Let $p \in \partial M$ and let $(U, \phi)$ be a boundary chart, and let $\pi:\bbH^n \mapsto \bbR^{n-1}$ be the projection onto the first $n-1$ coordinates.  Define

\begin{align*}
\partial U = \partial M \cap U && \hat{\partial U} = \phi(\partial U) && \psi = \pi \circ \phi|_{\partial U} : \partial U \mapsto \hat{\partial U}
\end{align*}

Following the argument of Theorem 5.8, $(\partial U, \psi)$ is a smooth chart for $\partial M$ as an $(n-1)$-dimensional manifold, and the collection of all such charts form a smooth atlas.

Note that $\partial M$ is a closed subset of $M$ and an $(n-1)$- dimensional topological manifold by Proposition 1.38.  Therefore by Proposition 5.5 $\partial M$ is properly embedded in $M$.
